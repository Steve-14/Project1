      <p>About the author of Greybone</p>
    </div>
    
      <div class=autobio>
        <p>Steve Mole has been involved in Roleplaying Games for as long as he can remember.</p>
        <p>Obsessed with collecting as many game systems as possible and writing a number of completely awful adventure scenarios
            to bore or terrorise his hapless fellow players.</p>
      </div>

      <div class=scary>
        <p>Whether its "ADnD" or "Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying", Steve has had a hand in playing or running the system.</p>
        <p>Steve is currently running his players (victims) through a Pathfinder 2e game using the "Abomination Vaults" module.
            His next game will use the Vaessen rules, a newer game based around Nordic folklore with strong horror elements!</p>  
        <p>Steve lives in North Staffordshire with 2 neurotic dogs. He adores a Snickers but finds bananas tiresome.</p>
